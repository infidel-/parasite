+ timeline: generate npcs in event location areas and areas around them. kill at least half of them if their total number is > 3
+ timeline: all events are numbered. the clue contents will refer to these numbers.
+ raising human society knowledge to 25 (50?) will unlock access to timeline screen
+ display a window with text when this happens: "What am I? What is my purpose? I must know."
+ timeline represents all that parasite knows about the events that resulted in its current state. It is a timeline of events in scenario with lists of participating persons. 
+ when player gains access to timeline, he receives a few clues to start
+ there are two types of clues - physical (computer, document, etc) and event npc memory contents
+ reading notes
+ there is a chance that memory/physical clue will have contents about the previous/next event (make a flag isHidden for special events that will bypass that)
+ event npcs and physical clues do not spawn until player has access to timeline
+ physical clues only spawn at event location
+ physical clues stop spawning when everything about that event is known
+ when player is in the area with live event npcs attached, they will spawn periodically
+ soldier, agent
*) control dog
*) first control human - limited evolution (only access memory)
*) finish evolving access memory - full evolution access
4) first evolving something with an organ - body features
*) first access memory - inventory + can learn about items/area objects
4) first learn about item/area object - skills
limit region access?
5) 25% human society knowledge - access to timeline
* cannot enter non-city area (move npcs to closeby enterable areas? still need to enter to gather physical clues)
* improvement screen scrolling
* +10 deceased
+ using "Access Memory" on possessed event npc will unlock what he knows about the timeline
+ set npc.memoryAccessed=true on accessing memory (also disable multiple memory scans?)
+ visually known event npcs must have an icon on them
* knowing a person's name, job/photo or location will allow researching them further - find the rest of info bits
* having known laptop or mobile phone in inventory allows player to research info about event npcs with Computer Use skill. Each successful attempt will automatically add +1 info bit for up to 3 npcs in the timeline that have at least name or job info bit known
* info bits are: name, job + photo, location, dead/alive
??? job agent ???
* when done, copy this to docs

Physical clue/Memory contents:
* event person name - allows researching that name
* event person job and photo - allows visually spotting this person in the crowd
* event person location - area x,y - allows actually finding that person
* event location - area x,y - allows gathering physical clues at that location
* event clue - each event note has a counter. filling that counter up will show player the note. there is 1-3 event clues in contents
* event note - rare, only on physical clues, will open full event note

timeline example:
...
Event 3: at (5,5)
 +  The military personnel formed a cordon surrounding the scene.
 -  ? [1/4]
 -  ? [0/4]
Participants:
 -  Jacob Redfield (?) at (?,?) [no photo]
 -  Jacob Redfield (?) at (4,5) [no photo]
 -  Jacob Redfield (soldier) at (4,5) [photo]
 + Jacob Redfield (soldier) at (4,5) [photo] [deceased]
 -  ?
...
Event 20:
  + The military personnel formed a cordon surrounding the scene.
Participants:
 -  Jacob Redfield (?) at (?,?) [no photo]
... +10 deceased persons ...
...
(+ means this person's memory has been mined)

scenario/
Scenario - flowchart of event/person/location
Variables
ScenarioAlienCrashLanding - actual scenario contents
Timeline - the events that actually happened
Event  - event contents
Person - event participants
Location - event location
Clue - available clue (generated in process of a game)


===============
===============
spawn player near last event location
modify starting interest/alertness according to scenario flow
military base and facility area types!
area type string id -> enum
RegionArea - change switch type -> tile into map
fix event npcs spawn by job (soldiers go to military bases)
police radio gives access to radio messages
spawn stuff that is seen by player immediately on entering area
remove dead npcs from area.npc on death
make reading notes multiple times?
"+10 persons scanned"?
add some unique traits for agents and soldiers


host memory + human society > 50 = access to infoweb
knowledges?

MASTERPLAN
============
area alertness - block normal area travel on high alertness
area interest - should bring something special
police messages should be shown only if player has gained something
world generation
human biology knowledge
canine biology knowledge
city and world travel
operation generation
information web (based on clue gathering)

LATER
=====
cell phone
ecm jammer improvement
host perks - for ex, fat people have more energy overall, so they are more desirable
some evolution can only happen if player has access to prerequisites, for example, stands on top of some object
more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
fast travel in cars in region mode - entering the car will turn it on
global suspicion and what comes with its growth (no global suspicion?)
region mode: do not despawn area until player moves?
swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
swat units have gas masks and armor
armor - vest + helmet
stunner
walkable city sewers (should i?)
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp
organ damage - organ must heal itself before it becomes active again

scene. getSpriteByLayer(layer) - draw lines on this one
write about getPixels/setPixels bug

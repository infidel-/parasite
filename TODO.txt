1) (todo fluff) - write at least something to help players
2) body features with timeouts should show them on hud
3) explain that number will select an option
4) game restart
x-1) write a readme and a short guide
x) release asking feedback

smooth out building tiles when they are not wide enough

what happens on mission failure
mission - infiltration
mission - research
goal - save alien
what if player raises alertness in ship location? i should handle that somehow
area interest is unused
mission - abduction - chance of target being a soldier in a base or vip in facility
?bug - can go to spaceship without goal - breaks goal completion
mission completed, what if spaceship is crashed
add spaceship object to global object map or make easier getObject(id) function or 
debug mode - timeline - show numeric event id

==
CONSOLE CHEATSHEET:
;le12 - learn about aliens
;le8 - learn location of spaceship

;le11 - learn about aliens (other branch)
;le7 - learn location of spaceship (other branch)

;ge8 - go to spaceship location

;ga10 10 - go to area at 10,10
;gg24 7 - don't change mode, go to x=24, y=7 (area or region)

;s1 - player stage 1

MASTERPLAN
============
area alertness - block normal area travel on high alertness
area interest - should bring something special
world generation
human biology knowledge
canine biology knowledge
city and world travel

LATER
=====
?? more knowledges
make each AI type more unique
==
- "Biomineralization" goal chain (after "habitat" goal chain):
- GOAL: get "Biomineralization" improvement
- GOAL: grow "Biomineral base" organ. When this organ finishes, special action "Grow a biomineral" appears.
- GOAL: grow biomineral. can only be grown in habitat. current host converts into a biomineral on that cell that supplies additional energy to cells around it. biomineral has a lifetime that depends on host stats.
- while near the biomineral growing organs and evolution is faster
==
police radio gives access to radio messages

radio transceiver improvement:
lv1 - listen to police/security radio
lv2 - listen to 
lv3 - listen to cellphone comms

em noise improvement:
lv1 - civilians cannot call for help in small radius
lv2 - radius+
lv3 - radius++

1) find police radio/security radio
2) evolve radio receiver
3) grow receiver
==

search in timeline
?? Area -> move some code to game/AreaGame, some to entities/Area
add useful info into improvement notes on evolution screen
tooltips in area and region mode (type, habitat, clues, events, alertness, etc)
organ actions -> OrganInfo.actionXXX
inventory actions -> ItemInfo.actionXXX
move Const.PLAYER_ACTION into proper classes?
ecm jammer improvement
host perks - for ex, fat people have more energy overall, so they are more desirable
some evolution can only happen if player has access to prerequisites, for example, stands on top of some object
more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
fast travel in cars in region mode - entering the car will turn it on
global suspicion and what comes with its growth (no global suspicion?)
region mode: do not despawn area until player moves?
swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
swat units have gas masks and armor
armor - vest + helmet
stunner
walkable city sewers (should i?)
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp
organ damage - organ must heal itself before it becomes active again
limit region access (until some learning flag triggers, initial progression)
- ?? make tilemap screen-sized and repaint with each movement ??
- i should probably make some habitat imps that will notify player about detection.


scene. getSpriteByLayer(layer) - draw lines on this one
write about getPixels/setPixels bug

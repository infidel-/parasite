+ when player is in area mode, habitat detection attempt happens each 10 turns
+ if the player is in habitat, it cannot be detected
+ spawn player near last event location
+ modify starting interest/alertness according to scenario flow
military base and facility area types!
area type string id -> enum
RegionArea - switch type -> tile into map
fix event npcs spawn by job (soldiers go to military bases)
police radio gives access to radio messages
spawn stuff that is seen by player immediately on entering area
remove dead npcs from area.npc on death
make reading notes multiple times?
+ "+10 persons probed"
add some unique traits for agents and soldiers
search in timeline
more readable types
scenario-based goals
area interest is unused


MASTERPLAN
============
area alertness - block normal area travel on high alertness
area interest - should bring something special
police messages should be shown only if player has gained something
world generation
human biology knowledge
canine biology knowledge
city and world travel
operation generation
information web (based on clue gathering)

LATER
=====
?? more knowledges
make each AI type more unique

- "Biomineralization" goal chain (after "habitat" goal chain):
- GOAL: get "Biomineralization" improvement
- GOAL: grow "Biomineral base" organ. When this organ finishes, special action "Grow a biomineral" appears.
- GOAL: grow biomineral. can only be grown in habitat. current host converts into a biomineral on that cell that supplies additional energy to cells around it. biomineral has a lifetime that depends on host stats.
- while near the biomineral growing organs and evolution is faster

?? Area -> move some code to game/AreaGame, some to entities/Area
add useful info into improvement notes on evolution screen
tooltips in area and region mode (type, habitat, clues, events, alertness, etc)
organ actions -> OrganInfo.actionXXX
inventory actions -> ItemInfo.actionXXX
move Const.PLAYER_ACTION into proper classes?
ecm jammer improvement
host perks - for ex, fat people have more energy overall, so they are more desirable
some evolution can only happen if player has access to prerequisites, for example, stands on top of some object
more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
fast travel in cars in region mode - entering the car will turn it on
global suspicion and what comes with its growth (no global suspicion?)
region mode: do not despawn area until player moves?
swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
swat units have gas masks and armor
armor - vest + helmet
stunner
walkable city sewers (should i?)
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp
organ damage - organ must heal itself before it becomes active again
limit region access (until some learning flag triggers, initial progression)
- ?? make tilemap screen-sized and repaint with each movement ??
- i should probably make some habitat imps that will notify player about detection.


scene. getSpriteByLayer(layer) - draw lines on this one
write about getPixels/setPixels bug

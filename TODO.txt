Information Web - This is displayed on a separate screen. This represents what the parasite knows about the events that resulted in its current state. It is a timeline of events in operation with lists of participating persons. At the start nothing is known but as the parasite unlocks memories of people that are close to these persons or are these persons, the web will fill up with information that eventually will reveal the masterminds and new goals.

scenario/
Scenario - flowchart of event/person/location
Variables
ScenarioAlienCrashLanding - actual scenario contents
Timeline - the events that actually happened
Event  - event contents
Person - event participants
Location - event location
Clue - available clue (generated in process of a game)

spawn player near last event location
modify starting interest/alertness according to scenario flow
military base and facility area types!
area type string id -> enum
RegionArea - change switch type -> tile into map

host memory + human society > 50 = access to infoweb
knowledges?

MASTERPLAN
============
area alertness - block normal area travel on high alertness
area interest - should bring something special
police messages should be shown only if player has gained something
world generation
human biology knowledge
canine biology knowledge
city and world travel
operation generation
information web (based on clue gathering)

LATER
=====
cell phone
ecm jammer improvement
host perks - for ex, fat people have more energy overall, so they are more desirable
some evolution can only happen if player has access to prerequisites, for example, stands on top of some object
more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
fast travel in cars in region mode - entering the car will turn it on
global suspicion and what comes with its growth (no global suspicion?)
region mode: do not despawn area until player moves?
swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
swat units have gas masks and armor
armor - vest + helmet
stunner
walkable city sewers (should i?)
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp
organ damage - organ must heal itself before it becomes active again

scene. getSpriteByLayer(layer) - draw lines on this one
write about getPixels/setPixels bug

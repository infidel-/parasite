============
area alertness
area interest
world generation
human biology knowledge
canine biology knowledge

more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
city and world travel
operation generation
information web

LATER
=====

swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
city sewers
armor - vest + helmet
stunner
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp

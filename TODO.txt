- test playthrough of the clue gathering
- add debug stage 3 (scenario goals)
- test scenario goals
- start work on area interest and conspiracy/antags
  - should become more active in the scenario goal phase

do not allow to esc from quit window, allow to start a new game or exit to main menu instead. allow watching logs and stuff!

if player releases live humans, they talk to authorities and media (i was possessed by an angel!)
releasing live agents increases The Group's mission priority
  - adds media exposure
  - adds area interest
  - adds area alertness
  - adds cleanup side missions (silence the reporter, erase memory, etc)
gauging media exposure and receiving the side missions is done by using computers
or building a special processing building?

police radio gives access to radio messages and opens up way to:

radio transceiver improvement:
lv1 - listen to police/security radio
lv2 - listen to
lv3 - listen to cellphone comms

em noise/ecm jammer improvement:
lv1 - civilians and police cannot call for help in small radius
lv2 - radius+
lv3 - radius++

habitat detection alert improvement:
no levels - marks with a red + on map, gives a message

1) find police radio/security radio
2) evolve radio receiver
3) grow receiver
==================================
LATER

scenes (sometimes need forensics)
police station -> forensics expert -> forensics
? news (newspapers, mobile)
books - forensics guide (15%), sherlock holmes (10%)

roads on region map leading to facilities
  fast travel on roads when in car
    entering a car
  disallow travel outside of city bounds by foot (no sewers)?
  disguise skill - allows hiding parasite without using improv
  disguise + assimilation allows using public transport and cars
    public transport and car rental costs money (gained from wallets)
  how to gain disguise skill?
  needs disguise kit?

? rework habitat detection from probability to counter based on interest (counter grows with each turn until it starts rolling chances based on interest)
game restart
citygen - smooth out building tiles when they are not wide enough
what happens on mission failure
scenario work and expansion:
  - alien weapons cache, has a chance of spawning (left by yourself)
  - mission - infiltration
  - mission - research
  - goal - save alien
  - what if player raises alertness in ship location? i should handle that somehow
  - mission - abduction - chance of target being a soldier in a base or vip in facility
  - mission completed, what if spaceship is crashed
  - add spaceship object to global object map or make easier getObject(id) function
  - expand hidden events - opening certain clues will lead to hidden events, that these clues hint on. For ex., ufologists clue:
    'Independent experts and conspiracy theorists may have some knowledge about the events.'
    - should open up a hidden event in some way.
?inventory actions - r1, l1, d1

=====
area alertness - block normal area travel on high alertness
? world generation
? world travel
?? more knowledges
make each AI type more unique
==
since use computer is max 30% (rarer 50%), search is very slow
  "use computer" goal completion should open next optional goal:
    find hacker and probe his brain (an alternative is to grind computer use)
    new area type - university
    add NPC age
    new NPC parameter - job
    university has professors and students (job types)
    search for a person with high skill X interface
    sub-menus:
      "u" opens "use item" menu
      "computer" item opens sub-menu
        "search for timeline info",
        "search for a person with high Computer Use skill"
    pressing "." will repeat previous "use" command
==
SCENARIO: CULT

sanity stat for the followers (they can get totally mad in the process)
high-level control path improv (research dopamine) that puts a euphoria-inducing biodrone on the host
  humans stay as loyal but free agents that can do the tasks set by the player
build a cult of followers
==
SCENARIO: SHADOW OUT OF TIME, GREAT RACE/PNAKOTUS

raise knowledge human society to max and build mind-swap device
raising knowledge requires special evolution imp - memory map
? need to tie in with the original idea
==
AREA INTEREST, CONSPIRACY

brain probing some event NPCs (marked with flags) should reveal the existence of the conspiracy (player antags)
  this is a special event that opens up the area interest indicator
  it might show when the habitat was compromised?
  it might open up new research venues?
area interest is unused
area interest should bring something special
killing conspiracy agents should increase both area interest and conspiracy interest
leaving conspiracy agent hosts should increase interest eventually
==
==

search in timeline
?? Area -> move some code to game/AreaGame, some to entities/Area
tooltips in area and region mode (type, habitat, clues, events, alertness, etc)
organ actions -> OrganInfo.actionXXX
inventory actions -> ItemInfo.actionXXX
move Const.PLAYER_ACTION into proper classes?
host traits - for ex, fat people have more energy overall, so they are more desirable
some evolution can only happen if player has access to prerequisites, for example, stands on top of some object
more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
region mode: do not despawn area until player moves?
swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
swat units have gas masks and armor
armor - vest + helmet
military stun rifles for the blackops with greater effect
walkable city sewers (should i?)
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp
organ damage - organ must heal itself before it becomes active again
limit region access (until some learning flag triggers, initial progression)
- ?? make tilemap screen-sized and repaint with each movement ??
use debug player stages as basis for a save system (allow saves only on some critical game events)
move all organ actions into EvolutionConst?
evolution fluff

MASTERPLAN
============
area alertness
area interest
world generation
human biology knowledge
canine biology knowledge
organ growth
city and world travel
operation generation

LATER
=====
more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
global suspicion and what comes with its growth (no global suspicion?)
region mode: do not despawn area until player moves?
swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
walkable city sewers (should i?)
armor - vest + helmet
stunner
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp

looting bodies
improvements impl: host release

scene. getSpriteByLayer(layer) - draw lines on this one
write about getPixels/setPixels bug

MASTERPLAN
============
area alertness
area interest - should bring something special
police messages should be shown only if player has gained something
world generation
human biology knowledge
canine biology knowledge
city and world travel
operation generation
information web

LATER
=====
more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
global suspicion and what comes with its growth (no global suspicion?)
region mode: do not despawn area until player moves?
swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
walkable city sewers (should i?)
armor - vest + helmet
stunner
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp

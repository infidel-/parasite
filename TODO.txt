evolution content - basic evolutions in each direction

MASTERPLAN
============
area alertness - block normal area travel on high alertness
area interest - should bring something special
police messages should be shown only if player has gained something
world generation
human biology knowledge
canine biology knowledge
city and world travel
operation generation
information web

LATER
=====
fat people have more energy overall, so they are more desirable
some evolution can only happen if player has access to prerequisites, for example, stands on top of the 
more believable city generation - areas, buildings, sidewalk, roadway, car traffic, traffic lights
cops arriving in cars
fast travel in cars in region mode - entering the car will turn it on
global suspicion and what comes with its growth (no global suspicion?)
region mode: do not despawn area until player moves?
swat + police calling backup brings swat when alertness stage is >= 1
walkable city sewers (should i?)
armor - vest + helmet
stunner
electric discharge improv + battery organ + stun attack
parasite smell + dogs + reducing smell intensivity imp
organ damage - organ must heal itself before it becomes active again
